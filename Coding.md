# Coding

General tips/advice/guidelines on coding. This is mostly theoretical.

Types of testing:

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Functional testing
* E2E (End-to-end testing)
    * E2E testing tools:
        * Selenium  
        * Cypress 
        * Puppeteer 
        
Other testing concepts:

* Mocking
* Stubbing
* TDD (Test Driven Development)
* BDD (Behavioral Driven Design)

**7. Design Patterns-EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**

Design Patterns are common patterns that we use when writing our software. 
They represent established best practices developed over time. 
These can then help us to ensure that our code is well designed and well built.

   * Creational Design Patterns - https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/creational-patterns
   * Structural Design Patterns - https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/structural-patterns
   * Behavioral Design Patterns - https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/behavioral-patterns
   
Main design patterns:

1. Creational Design Patterns\
Are design patterns that focus on how we obtain instances of objects. \
Typically, this means how we construct new instances of a class, but in some cases, it means obtaining an already constructed instance ready for us to use.\
Include:
    1. Factory Method
    2. Abstract Factory
    3. Builder
    4. Prototype
    5. Singleton

2. Structural Design Patterns\
Are those that simplify the design of large object structures by identifying relationships between them.\
They describe common ways of composing classes and objects so that they become repeatable as solutions.\
Include:
    1. Adapter
    2. Bridge
    3. Composite
    4. Decorator
    5. Facade
    6. Flyweight
    7. Proxy

3. Behavioral Design Patterns\
These focus on how our objects interact with each other or how we interact with them.\
Include:
    1. Chain of Responsibility
    2. Command
    3. Iterator
    4. Mediator
    5. Memento
    6. Observer
    7. State
    8. Strategy
    9. Template Method
    10. Visitor
    11. Interpreter

**8. SOLID Principles-EXTREMELY IMPORTANT**

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym, each letter represents one of the 
5 design principles.

   * https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solid-principles-explained-in-plain-english/

Principles:

* S - Single Responsibility

* O - Open-Close

* L - Liskov Substitution

* I - Interface Segregation

* D - Dependency Inversion
