**2. Datatypes**

   * https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/variables-datatypes
    
Find out:
   * Operations carried out on each e.g : inserting elements in a list
   * How to declare them
   * Functions that manipulate them
 
Types:
    
* Numeric - Represents data which has numeric value:
    * Integers – This value is represented by int class
    * Float – This value is represented by float class
    * Complex Numbers – Complex number is represented by complex class.

* Sequence Type - Sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types:
    * String - Arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters.
    * Lists - Just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data.
    * Tuples - Is also an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. It is represented by tuple class

* Dictionaries - Is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.

* Boolean - Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.

* Sets - An unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
